# Task Description
Implement PWA (Progressive Web App) functionality for the SentenCease (句读) application to enable offline use, mobile device installation, and enhanced user experience.

# Project Overview
SentenCease is a React-based English vocabulary learning application with the following features:
- Scientific spaced repetition system (SRS) for efficient learning
- Go backend with Gin framework and PostgreSQL database
- Frontend using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS

# Analysis
Current codebase structure:
- Frontend in `/frontend` using React+Vite
- Main application entrypoint: `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- React Router for navigation
- Zustand for state management
- Axios for API calls
- Authentication state persisted using Zustand persist
- No current PWA capabilities

Key pages for offline functionality:
- LearnPage.jsx: Core learning experience with flashcards
- SelectWordsPage.jsx: Selection of vocabulary to learn

API integration:
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- API calls for vocabulary, learning progress, and reviews

# Proposed Solution
1. Install necessary PWA dependencies:
   - vite-plugin-pwa
   - workbox-window

2. Configure Vite for PWA:
   - Update vite.config.js with PWA plugin
   - Create manifest.webmanifest
   - Configure Service Worker

3. Create PWA Assets:
   - Generate app icons (various sizes)
   - Create splash screens for mobile devices

4. Implement Offline Support:
   - Cache static assets and API responses
   - Implement IndexedDB for offline data storage
   - Sync mechanism for offline reviews

5. Enhance Mobile Experience:
   - Improve touch interactions
   - Add "Add to Home Screen" prompt
   - Responsive design improvements

# Final Review:
本次实现了句读（SentenCease）应用的PWA功能，包括：

1. 基本PWA配置
   - 安装并配置了必要的依赖
   - 创建了Web App Manifest
   - 设置了Service Worker

2. 离线功能支持
   - 使用IndexedDB实现了离线数据存储
   - 添加了离线API调用支持
   - 实现了数据同步机制

3. 移动端体验优化
   - 添加了网络状态指示器
   - 实现了PWA安装提示
   - 添加了滑动手势支持（左滑不认识，右滑认识，上滑模糊）
   - 创建了交互式滑动教程帮助用户学习

整体上，我们成功地将SentenCease转换为一个功能完善的PWA应用，用户可以将其安装到主屏幕，离线使用，并享受接近原生应用的交互体验。

**下一步建议**:
1. 添加实际的图标文件替换占位符
2. 进行构建并测试PWA功能
3. 考虑添加推送通知功能提醒用户每日学习
