# Task Description
Implement PWA (Progressive Web App) functionality for the SentenCease (句读) application to enable offline use, mobile device installation, and enhanced user experience.

# Project Overview
SentenCease is a React-based English vocabulary learning application with the following features:
- Scientific spaced repetition system (SRS) for efficient learning
- Go backend with Gin framework and PostgreSQL database
- Frontend using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS

# Analysis
Current codebase structure:
- Frontend in `/frontend` using React+Vite
- Main application entrypoint: `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- React Router for navigation
- Zustand for state management
- Axios for API calls
- Authentication state persisted using Zustand persist
- No current PWA capabilities

Key pages for offline functionality:
- LearnPage.jsx: Core learning experience with flashcards
- SelectWordsPage.jsx: Selection of vocabulary to learn

API integration:
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- API calls for vocabulary, learning progress, and reviews

# Proposed Solution
1. Install necessary PWA dependencies:
   - vite-plugin-pwa
   - workbox-window

2. Configure Vite for PWA:
   - Update vite.config.js with PWA plugin
   - Create manifest.webmanifest
   - Configure Service Worker

3. Create PWA Assets:
   - Generate app icons (various sizes)
   - Create splash screens for mobile devices

4. Implement Offline Support:
   - Cache static assets and API responses
   - Implement IndexedDB for offline data storage
   - Sync mechanism for offline reviews

5. Enhance Mobile Experience:
   - Improve touch interactions
   - Add "Add to Home Screen" prompt
   - Responsive design improvements

# Current execution step: "8. Add offline data sync mechanism"
