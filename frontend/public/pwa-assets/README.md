# PWA Assets for SentenCease

This directory contains assets needed for the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality.

## Icons

The `icons` directory should contain the following icon sizes:
- icon-192x192.png (192x192px)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512px)
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180px)
- favicon.ico (16x16px, 32x32px, 48x48px)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using tools like:
1. [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
2. [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator)
3. Image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or online editors

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create actual icons, placeholder files have been created with the correct dimensions but should be replaced with branded icons before deployment.
